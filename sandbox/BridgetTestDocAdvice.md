****this is a compilation of my favorite advice, mostly from my mother****

----------


- What have you done for others today
- If the universe didn't need you, you wouldn't be here
- Be somebody that makes everyone feel like a somebody
- Remember that other people's negative opinions on you are only a reflection of how they feel about themselves and that has nothing to do with you
- Never stop believing the world is a beautiful place
- Our attitude defines our altitude. So be the one who walks forward with the head held high.
